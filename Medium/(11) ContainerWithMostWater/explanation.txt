This solution is a typical two pointer problem with a slight trick.

We are trying to find the maximum area in the list.
To do this we need to keep track of current max and keep two pointers to test new areas.
Inside our loop we will take the minimum heigh of the two pointers to find our y and we will find
distance between our two pointers as our x values.
Multiplied together this gives us our area between two points.
Then we need to move the pointers. To do this I simply move the left if the height from the left is less
or equal to the right. Otherwise we move the right pointer back one.
Then return the current max we found from looping.
