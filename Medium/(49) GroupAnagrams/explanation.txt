This is a very straight forward medium problem. We are asked to analyze if there are any anagrams
in a list and group them in the return.

For this approach I want you to think about a map that can add a key on the fly
Pythons defaultdict(list) creates a dictionary that allows for each key to be added with a list attached

1. Create defaultdict(list) this our full dictionary
2. iterate over the list of strings given by word
3. For each word we are sorting it and using it as a key so that if multiple words get sorted the same (boom anagram)
4. Then we need to return a list of the values this will make a list of all of the values attached to each key.
