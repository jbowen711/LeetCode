3sum is a two pointer problem with a catch.

We are looking combinations of 3 numbers instead of 2 that all add to 0. In order to solve this we need a 0(n^2) solution.
We need to loop through an i and then loop the array again using l and r to find the other values.


Steps:
To make this easier we should first sort the numbers input.
We want to create a result list to append lists of 0 combinations.

Lets loop through the range of nums
Lets check duplicates by comparing prev i value
We can also optimize by checking to see if the values at i > 0 if it is we already know we are breaking
since r and l will also be greater than 0


Now set pointers
l = i + 1 
r = n - 1

loop
find sum
if we find that it equals 0 append
now check duplicates for the pointers by using a loop to compare prev values change pointers accordingly
finally if our sum is not 0 move r and l accordingly


return res
